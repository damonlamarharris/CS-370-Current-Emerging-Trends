About This Repository

This repository contains my Pirate Intelligent Agent project, developed as part of my coursework on Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks.
In this project, I used Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to train a pirate agent to navigate a maze and locate treasure. The project demonstrates how intelligent systems can use feedback and experience to learn optimal actions in complex environments.
The Jupyter Notebook file (pirate_agent.ipynb) includes:
	• Environment setup and visualization
	• Deep Q-learning implementation
	• Experience replay memory
	• Epsilon-greedy exploration
	• Neural network training and evaluation

Project Overview
This project applies reinforcement learning principles to train an intelligent pirate agent. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for finding the treasure and penalties for wrong moves.
The starter code included:
	• The maze environment (TreasureMaze class)
	• Display and helper functions
	• A partially completed qtrain() function with pseudocode
I implemented the missing components, including:
	• The full Deep Q-learning algorithm
	• Experience replay logic
	• Reward system and Q-value updates
	• State encoding for neural network input
	• Hyperparameter tuning for training stability
Through multiple training runs and analysis, I ensured the model achieved a consistent 100% win rate and optimal pathfinding performance.

Connection to Computer Science
Computer scientists design systems that learn, adapt, and solve problems efficiently. This project demonstrates the intersection of algorithms, data, and intelligence, which defines modern computer science.
Reinforcement learning, in particular, has real-world applications in:
	• Autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving cars, robotics)
	• Healthcare and logistics optimization
	• Game AI and simulations
	• Adaptive control systems
Working on this project strengthened my understanding of how computer science bridges theory and practice—from designing logical models to building systems that improve through experience.

My Approach as a Computer Scientist
I followed a structured, iterative approach:
	1. Analyze the problem: Understand the maze environment and define success metrics.
	2. Design the agent: Plan how the agent perceives states and takes actions.
	3. Implement and train: Code the deep Q-learning logic and train the neural network.
	4. Test and refine: Adjust parameters, visualize outcomes, and evaluate learning efficiency.
This mirrors the scientific problem-solving process central to computer science combining logical reasoning, experimentation, and evaluation.

Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, I must ensure that the systems I build are ethical, transparent, and responsible. This involves:
	• Preventing bias in AI training data
	• Respecting user privacy and data protection
	• Designing systems that are safe, interpretable, and aligned with human values
	• Ensuring the technology serves both individual and societal good
Ethical AI development is essential for building public trust and ensuring long-term positive impact.

Key Skills Demonstrated
	• Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
	• Neural Networks using Keras/TensorFlow
	• Python and Jupyter Notebooks
	• Reinforcement Learning Environment Design
	• Experience Replay and Epsilon-Greedy Exploration
	• Model Evaluation and Debugging

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to real-world pathfinding and decision-making problems. By designing, training, and refining an intelligent agent, I gained hands-on experience in neural network architecture, training optimization, and AI ethics all essential skills for a modern computer scientist.
